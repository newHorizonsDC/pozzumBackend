Install dependencies (locally):
```
npm install
```

run server:
```
node server.js
```

In order to test the server using the html/javascript client, navigate to localhost:3000 with your webbrowser. Create and login with two separate users in different tabs and try to connect to one of them from the other. Make sure to set SERVER_IP in [client/app.js](client/app.js).
